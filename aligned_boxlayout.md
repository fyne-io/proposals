# Aligned BoxLayout

Following the discussion in [#1840](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne/pull/1840), cross axis alignment would be useful for `fyne.Layouts` to allow them be able to organize widgets with different cross axis sizes.

## Glossary

MainAxis and CrossAxis:

| Axis      | VBox       | HBox       |
| --------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| MainAxis  | Vertical   | Horizontal |
| CrossAxis | Horizontal | Vertical   |

## Background

Currently, Fyne has two kinds of layout to work with horizontal and vertical alignment:

- `BoxLayouts` => `VBox` and `HBox`
- `GridLayouts` => `GridWithColumns` and `GridWithRows`

`BoxLayouts` resize objects to their min size in the main axis and stretch their cross axis size.

`GridLayouts` resize objects to have the same size in the main axis and stretch their cross axis size.

---

None of them offers a way to align elements in the cross axis, although that behavior can be accomplished doing some workaround. For example if we want this result:

<img width="202" alt="" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12239342/106949421-ea147b00-66fa-11eb-9e45-b40d165e1851.png">

We should write something like:

```go
c := container.NewVBox(
	container.NewHBox(
		widget.NewEntry(),
		container.NewVBox(layout.NewSpacer(), createIcon(theme.ContentCopyIcon())),
		container.NewVBox(layout.NewSpacer(), createIcon(theme.ContentPasteIcon())),
		container.NewVBox(layout.NewSpacer(), createIcon(theme.ContentRemoveIcon())),
	),
)
```

Proposed solution would allow us to write:

```go
c := container.NewHBoxAligned(layout.CrossAlignmentEnd,
	widget.NewEntry(),
	createIcon(theme.ContentCopyIcon()),
	createIcon(theme.ContentPasteIcon()),
	createIcon(theme.ContentRemoveIcon()),
)
```

It also would allow us to solve cross axis alignment problems for text-based widgets as discussed in [#1701](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne/issues/1701) using the option `layout.CrossAlignmentBaseline`.

### Other use cases from users issues

#### 1. Issue #2057 (related to expanded feature)

User wanted something like this:

<img width="200" alt="" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12239342/110042678-1af4c980-7d14-11eb-833c-9ce817386cde.png">

He began with a `container.VBox` as it seems to be the more logical start, however then he realized,
that he cannot build that interface with `VBox`, so he blocks and raises an issue. Although, it is possible to do it with current API:

```go
logEntry := widget.NewLabel("Log text\n" + loremIpsum)
logEntry.Wrapping = fyne.TextWrapWord
logBox := container.NewScroll(logEntry)
content := container.NewBorder(
	container.NewVBox(inputEntry, beginBtn),
	container.NewVBox(stopBtn, resultEntry),
	nil, nil,
	logBox,
)
```

Maybe it would not be easy for new users, and a bit confusing. Also it maybe would push extra work to the app as it would need to build 3 containers (1 Border and 2 VBoxes). Proposed solution would increase code readability and use only 1 container:

```go
logEntry := widget.NewLabel("Log text\n" + loremIpsum)
logEntry.Wrapping = fyne.TextWrapWord
logBox := container.NewScroll(logEntry)
content := container.NewVBox(
	inputEntry,
	beginBtn,
	layout.NewExpander(logBox),
	stopBtn,
	resultEntry,
)
```

## Architecture / API

### 1. New `TextBaselineable` interface type

To accomplish baseline alignment, container would need to know about the text baseline of the given canvas objects, so a way to expose this value could be through a new interface type called `TextBaselineable` (or something similar):

```go
// canvasobject.go
package fyne

// TextBaselineable describes any object that has the ability to be aligned based on
// its text baseline.
type TextBaselineable interface {
	// DistanceToTextBaseline returns the distance from the top of the object until
	// its text baseline.
	DistanceToTextBaseline() float32
}
```

Currently, this interface would be implemented by:

- `canvas.Text`
- `widget.Button`
- `widget.Check`
- `widget.Entry`
- `widget.Hyperlink`
- `widget.Label`
- `widget.SelectEntry`
- `widget.Select`

### 2. New `layout.CrossAlignment` type

There should be a new type called CrossAlignment (name suggestions are welcome!):

```go
// CrossAlignment defines cross axis alignment type.
type CrossAlignment int

// Cross Axis alignment options.
const (
	CrossAlignmentStart CrossAlignment = iota
	CrossAlignmentEnd
	CrossAlignmentCenter
	CrossAlignmentBaseline
	CrossAlignmentStretch
)
```

This type would help us to specify the cross axis alignment in box layouts.

- `CrossAlignmentStart`: Align the content to the Top (HBox) or Left (VBox).
- `CrossAlignmentEnd`: Align the content to the Bottom (HBox) or Right (VBox).
- `CrossAlignmentCenter`: Center the content vertically (HBox) or horizontally (VBox).
- `CrossAlignmentBaseline`: This option is only useful for HBox, it aligns the content to the text baseline. For VBox, this alignment would behave as CrossAlignmentStart.
- `CrossAlignmentStretch`: Stretch the cross axis size of the children (current behavior).

### 3. New container constructors

- `container.NewVBox(objects...)`: It would work just as before (setting crossAlignment to CrossAlignmentStretch).
- `container.NewVBoxAligned(crossAlignment, objects...)`: It would work just like `NewVBox`, but instead of stretching the cross axis by default, user can set the desired cross alignment.
- `container.NewHBox(objects...)`: It would work just as before (setting crossAlignment to CrossAlignmentStretch).
- `container.NewHBoxAligned(crossAlignment, objects...)`: It would work just like `NewHBox`, but instead of stretching the cross axis by default, user can set the desired cross alignment.

### 4. New canvas object `layout.NewExpander`

Unfortunately, current `container.NewBorder` could not be used very well (to expand objects) alongside with the new `BoxAligned` containers. I mean it could be used but you won't be able to perform any kind of alignment, because in this case `container.NewBorder` would have the reponsability to align the objects.
To mitigate this limitation, a new canvas object under the layout package is proposed: `layout.NewExpander`.

Just like the `Spacer`, `Expanders` objects only have real meaning inside a box layout. This object works like a wrapper for an actual object that will expand its main axis inside a box layout.

```go
layout.NewExpander(child)
```

## Implementation

The initial implementation can be found in (while this remains as proposal): https://github.com/fpabl0/fyne/tree/feature/aligned-boxlayout

This fork is not replacing current VBox and HBox layouts, in order to compare them. It adds a new layout `nboxLayout` to test this implementation (under `cmd/nboxlayout_demo`).

## Prior art

Most of the popular hybrid frameworks/toolkits for app development offer alignment options for elements on the two axis.

### 1. Web based - Ionic

Ionic has a grid layout called [`ion-grid`](https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/grid) that is defined as:

> a powerful mobile-first flexbox system for building custom layouts. It is composed of three units — a grid, row(s) and column(s). Columns will expand to fill the row, and will resize to fit additional columns.

So basically an `ion-grid` is composed by `ion-row`s and `ion-col`s. The alignment on main and cross axis is selected through css classes:

- [`.ion-justify-content-start` ...](https://ionicframework.com/docs/layout/css-utilities#flex-container-properties)
- [`.ion-align-items-start` ...](https://ionicframework.com/docs/layout/css-utilities#flex-container-properties)
- [`.ion-align-self-start` ...](https://ionicframework.com/docs/layout/css-utilities#flex-item-properties)

However, I think those css classes names are really confusing.

### 2. Flutter

Almost every Flutter app layout can be created using two (or three) main components (or widgets as Flutter calls them). These components are: [`Row`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Row-class.html), [`Column`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Column-class.html) and [`Expanded`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Expanded-class.html). As you will notice, this proposal is mainly based on Flutter implementation.

- Row widget example:

```dart
Row(
  mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.start,
  crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center,
  children: [
    const FlutterLogo(),
    const Expanded(
      child: Text("Some text......."),
    ),
    const Icon(Icons.sentiment_very_satisfied),
  ],
)
```

- Column widget example:

```dart
Column(
  mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.start,
  crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
  children: [
    Text('We move under cover and we move as one'),
    Text('Through the night, we have one shot to live another day'),
    Text('We cannot let a stray gunshot give us away'),
    Text('We will fight up close, seize the moment and stay in it'),
    Text('It’s either that or meet the business end of a bayonet'),
    Text('The code word is ‘Rochambeau,’ dig me?'),
    Text('Rochambeau!'),
  ],
)
```
